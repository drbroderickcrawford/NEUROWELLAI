# Neurowell AI

Welcome to Neurowell AI — empowering brain health and cognitive resilience through advanced artificial intelligence, neuroscience, and deeply human-centered care.

## 🌟 Our Mission

Neurowell AI is on a mission to transform the way we approach cognitive health and neuro-recovery. We combine cutting-edge AI models with neuroscience and health psychology to deliver personalized, data-driven solutions that empower patients, families, and healthcare providers worldwide.

## 💡 What We Do

- **AI-driven cognitive assessment tools** that adapt to individual progress
- **Guided neuroplasticity exercise protocols** designed for recovery and performance
- **Remote monitoring dashboards** for clinicians and caregivers
- **Wearable technology integration** for continuous tracking
- **Future-ready quantum computing roadmap** for next-level prediction and intervention

## 🧩 Surgical Applications: Advancing Pediatric Neurosurgery

As part of NeuroWell AI’s mission, we’re expanding into pediatric neurosurgical innovation. This layer supports surgical teams and families before, during, and after tumor-related brain procedures using AI + Quantum insights.

### 🚨 Key Goals:
- **AI-Driven Tumor Classification** — assist in pre-op planning with accurate model predictions
- **Quantum-Enhanced Functional Mapping** — preserve critical regions via hybrid modeling
- **Surgical Simulation + Overlay (Coming)** — visual support using Vision Pro/AR
- **Post-Surgical Cognitive Tracking** — integrated with recovery modules already built

This initiative builds on our existing brain recovery pipeline and uses the same modular architecture for easy integration.

> *“Our recovery models now inform how we prepare for and recover from surgery—with the same mission: preserve childhood cognition.”*

### 📊 Notebook: Grad‑CAM Simulation for Pediatric Neurosurgical AI

This notebook demonstrates the use of a basic CNN model to generate Grad‑CAM overlays for synthetic MRI images. While the data is simulated, this prototype is designed to:

- Test model visualization workflows for pediatric neurosurgical contexts (e.g., astrocytoma, CJD).
- Serve as a template for integrating Grad‑CAM into NeuroWell AI’s surgical planning modules.
- Be extended to real-world DICOM data as datasets are acquired.
